            "\n",
            "However, based on a combination of historical impact, peak performance, longevity, and general consensus, here's a list of 10 footballers often considered among the greatest of all time, in no particular order:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Pelé (Brazil):**  Often called \"The King,\" Pelé won three World Cups (1958, 1962, 1970) and scored a staggering number of goals (though the exact number is debated).  His impact on the game and his global icon status are undeniable.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Diego Maradona (Argentina):**  A genius with the ball, Maradona single-handedly led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup victory.  His skill, creativity, and passion were unmatched.  His \"Hand of God\" goal and his incredible solo goal against England are legendary.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Lionel Messi (Argentina):**  Many consider Messi the greatest ever.  His dribbling, goal-scoring record, playmaking ability, and overall consistency are phenomenal.  He has won numerous Ballon d'Or awards and led Argentina to the 2022 World Cup title.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal):**  A goal-scoring machine with incredible athleticism and dedication.  Ronaldo has won league titles in multiple countries, numerous Champions League titles, and the European Championship with Portugal.  His longevity and relentless pursuit of excellence are remarkable.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Johan Cruyff (Netherlands):**  A revolutionary player and coach.  Cruyff was the embodiment of \"Total Football\" and led the Netherlands to the 1974 World Cup final.  He also had a profound impact on Barcelona's playing style.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Franz Beckenbauer (Germany):**  \"Der Kaiser\" was a dominant defender and a visionary leader.  He captained West Germany to victory in the 1974 World Cup and the 1972 European Championship.  He also revolutionized the sweeper role.\n",
            "\n",
            "7.  **Zinedine Zidane (France):**  An elegant and supremely skilled midfielder.  Zidane led France to victory in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.  He also won the Champions League with Real Madrid.\n",
            "\n",
            "8.  **Alfredo Di Stéfano (Argentina/Spain):**  A dominant force in the 1950s and 60s, Di Stéfano led Real Madrid to five consecutive European Cup titles.  He was a complete player, capable of scoring, defending, and creating chances.\n",
            "\n",
            "9.  **Ronaldo Nazário (Brazil):**  \"O Fenômeno\" was an explosive and incredibly talented striker.  He won two World Cups with Brazil (1994 and 2002) and was known for his incredible dribbling and finishing ability. Injuries hampered his career, but his peak was breathtaking.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. **George Best (Northern Ireland):** A dazzling winger with incredible skill and charisma. Best was a key player for Manchester United in the 1960s, winning the European Cup in 1968. His talent was undeniable, but his career was cut short due to off-field issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Era:** It's difficult to compare players from different eras due to changes in tactics, rules, and the overall physicality of the game.\n",
            "*   **Position:** Comparing a striker to a defender is inherently challenging.\n",
            "*   **Subjectivity:** Ultimately, personal preference plays a significant role.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Other players often mentioned in \"greatest of all time\" discussions include:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   Michel Platini\n",
            "*   Ferenc Puskás\n",
            "*   Eusébio\n",
            "*   Gerd Müller\n",
